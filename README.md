<p>This application is meant to serve as an Inventory Management System for a book shop!</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Users can search the Google Books API for books to add to your inventory through the "Order" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their current Order and use the "Confirm Order" Button to add those books to their inventory
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their updated Inventory and edit it by either Ordering more books, or using the "Sell" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Sell" feature works the same as the "Order" feature, but in the opposite manner.  It removes books from your inventory
  </li>
</ul>
