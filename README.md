# Bookworm

<p>Project is live on: </p>

<a href="http://bookworm-2020.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>


<p>This application is meant to serve as an Inventory Management System for a book shop!</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Users can search the Google Books API for books to add to your inventory through the "Order" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their current Order and use the "Confirm Order" Button to add those books to their inventory
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their updated Inventory and edit it by either Ordering more books, or using the "Sell" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Sell" feature works the same as the "Order" feature, but in the opposite manner.  It removes books from your inventory
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>As of now, each user only has access to their own personal inventory</p>
<p>In the future, possible expansion to add assignment of access via email address or other form of ID</p>
