# Bookworm

<p>Project is live on: </p>

<a href="http://bookworm-2020.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>


<p>This application is meant to serve as an Inventory Management System for a book shop!</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Users can search the Google Books API for books to add to your inventory through the "Order" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their current Order and use the "Confirm Order" Button to add those books to their inventory
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can view their updated Inventory and edit it by either Ordering more books, or using the "Sell" feature
  </li>
  <li>
    The "Sell" feature works the same as the "Order" feature, but in the opposite manner.  It removes books from your inventory
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> Example flow:
  <ul>
    <li>Log in</li>
    <li>Click search in the navbar</li>
    <li>search for a book by title</li>
    <li>click on it to navigate to its details page</li>
    <li>click the order button and fill out the modal</li>
    <li>navigate to the order screen using the navbar</li>
    <li>submit the order</li>
    <li>The book will appear in the inventory</li>
    <li>Click the truck icon next to a book to sell it, the form appears at the top of the table</li>
    <li>After completing the form, navigate to the sales page</li>
    <li>Confirm the sale</li>
    <li>Inventory updates</li>
   </ul>
<br>
<p>As of now, every user has access to the same inventory</p>
<p>In the future, possible expansion to add assignment of access via email address or other form of ID</p>
